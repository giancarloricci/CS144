====================

My name: Giancarlo Ricci

My SUNet ID: gricci

I collaborated with: jackle, yousifm, ifreitas

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: yousifm, ifreitas, jackle

This checkpoint took me about 2 hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

Solo portion:

- Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself? yes

Yes, I successfully was able to send a message between myself using!

./apps/endtoend server cs144.keithw.org 1942
./apps/endtoend client cs144.keithw.org 1943 


- Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt? 

Yes! I both received the file, and verified both have the same sha sum.

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps:

Fortunately, no code changes were needed! 

Group portion:

- Who is your lab partner (and what is their SUNet ID, e.g. "winstein"?)

jackle 

- Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as ``client'' or as ``server'')?

Yes - both our implementations successfully worked as both clients and server.

- Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two
  implementations, with contents identical upon receipt?

Yes we did! (confirmed with the sha)

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass
  these steps, either by you or your lab partner.

Fortunately, there were no required code changes for either of us!
