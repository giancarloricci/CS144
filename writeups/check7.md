My name: [your name here]

My SUNet ID: [your sunetid here]

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [list sunetids here]

This checkpoint took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

Solo portion:

- Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself? yes

Yes, I successfully was able to send a message between myself using:


./apps/endtoend server cs144.keithw.org 1942
./apps/endtoend client cs144.keithw.org 1943 


- Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt? yes! both got the file with sha: 
dcd19d82496e9457c28d8cc32f45966f8c77364e69aa7b66ced5d20779ab7067

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps:

Fortunately, no code changes were needed! 

Group portion:

- Who is your lab partner (and what is their SUNet ID, e.g. "winstein"?)

jackle 

- Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as ``client'' or as ``server'')?

Yes; both successfully worked as both clients and server.

- Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two
  implementations, with contents identical upon receipt?

Yes we did! (confirmed with the SHA)

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass
  these steps, either by you or your lab partner.

There were no required code changes for either of us!
